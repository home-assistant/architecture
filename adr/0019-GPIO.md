# 0018. GPIO

Date: 2021-12-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We currently have a lot of integrations that use or are based on GPIO (including SPI and i2c busses).

- All of these integrations have a low usage count (source Home Assistant Analytics),
  but it adds the same amount of maintenance and review time to the core.
- Most of these integrations are unmaintained.
- The use of GPIO via containers (including our Home Assistant OS, Container
  & Supervised installation methods) is often unstable or complicated.
- Support for GPIO on specific platforms/SBCs: milage varies (e.g., Raspberry Pi on 64 bits platforms).
- The use of these sensors, in general, is better supported and done via dedicated projects like ESPHome.

## Decision

We no longer accepting integrations that integrate with devices over GPIO.

## Consequences

No longer accepting integrations that integrate with devices over GPIO.
