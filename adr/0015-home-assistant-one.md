## Decision

### Required Expertise

- **Installation**
  Installation requires the user to install the disk image for their device, install an image flasher (Etcher) and flash the image to the disk. Then insert image and boot their device.

* **Start when the system is started:** Managed by installer
* **Run with full network access:** Managed by installer
* **Access USB devices:** Managed by supervisor

* **Maintaining the Home Assistant installation**
  Ongoing maintenance can be done via the user interface. User will be notified if an update is available for the operating system or for Home Assistant. Updates will be automatically rolled back if they fail.

  - **Python upgrades:** Managed via HA updates
  - **Installing Python dependencies:** Managed via HA updates
  - **Updating Home Assistant:** Via a UI

- **Maintaining the Operating System**
  Ongoing maintenance can be done via the user interface. User will be notified if an update is available for the operating system. Updates will be automatically rolled back if they fail.

* **Security updates for OS:** Managed via HA OS updates

* **Maintaining the components required for the Supervisor:** Managed via HA OS updates

**Conclusion:** low expertise required. Besides the installation methods, everything is done via the UI.

## Consequences

Update documentation on how to install this method, the required experience and the expected maintenance.

Move existing related documentation that does not match the requirements to the community guides wiki.

Add checks to Home Assistant to warn (but not forbid) when not all requirements are met for this installation method.
